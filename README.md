SCUBA performs spectral analysis of along-track and gridded dataset, as well as spectral statistical comparison between two fields (e.g., along-track vs grid, grid vs grid).

# Structure of SCUBA

          share                 src           test_case                tools
```
* `share` contains information or files for running the program, e.g. the distance from closest land point (needed for coastal editing) or altimeter mission information
* `src` contains the python scripts to perform the analysis
* `test_case` provides test cases to test the program
* `tools` includes scripts to display spectrum, resolution and spectral Taylor Diagram 

# Background 

* `scuba_alongtrack.py` performs spectral analysis on along-track data or between along-track and gridded data
* `scuba_grid.py` performs spectral analysis on gridded data or between two gridded data

The program is structured as follow:
* 1- reading the dataset

* 2- computing segment (along-track, or zonal or meridional) database

<b>Example zonal direction</b>

<b>Example meridional direction</b>

</p>

* 3- performing spectral analysis in boxes by selecting all the segments of the database found within the box

* 4- gridding the results

* 5- writing netCDF output

# First step with SCUBA
## Running test cases
---
     >> cd test_case/
     >> python ../src/scuba_grid.py example_scuba_grid.yaml
	 >> python ../src/scuba_alongtrack.py example_scuba_alongtrack.yaml

This test cases performs spectral analysis on altimeter maps and along-track data. For more detail on the analysis parameters see *.yaml parameter files.

## Visualisation of the results
---
     >> cd tools
     >> python display_resolution.py ../test_case/psd_alongtrack_direction.nc

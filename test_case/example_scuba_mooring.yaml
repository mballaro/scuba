inputs:
   # input_file_directory: folder containing SLA from tide gauge and CMEMS maps (one file per TG)
   input_file_directory: ./inputs/moorings/
   input_file_pattern: 'dyn*.nc'

properties:
    # corr_coef: minimum correlation criterion threshold between SLA map and SLA TG to perform analysis
    corr_coef: 0.0

    spectral_parameters:
        # lenght_scale: segment lenght in days to consider in the spectral subsampling (ex: 100)
        # delta_t: temporal sampling input
        lenght_scale: 100.
